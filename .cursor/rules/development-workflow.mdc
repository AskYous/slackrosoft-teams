The following npm scripts are available in [ms-teams-app/package.json](mdc:ms-teams-app/package.json):

- **dev**: `vite` - Run the development server
- **build**: `tsc -b && vite build` - Type check and build the application
- **lint**: `eslint .` - Run the linter
- **preview**: `vite preview` - Preview the built application

## Development Environment

- Node.js and npm are required
- After cloning, run `npm install` to install dependencies
